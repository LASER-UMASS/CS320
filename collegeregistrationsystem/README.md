This is an initial prototype of the backend for the registration system for Greenville Community College:
- src: Contains the code for this application (as Java source files)
- test: Contains the test suite for the application (as a Java source file)
- lib: Contains the JUnit4 library (as a jar file)
- bin: Will contain the Java class files generated by the compiler from the Java source files
- jdoc: Will contain the API documentation generated by javadoc (as HTML files). To start, open the jdoc/index.html file in a web browser.
- build.xml: Contains an Ant build file for the application and its test suite

The build requirements are:
- JDK 11 or higher: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/
- JUnit 4: https://junit.org/junit4/ (Already provided in the lib folder)
- Ant: https://ant.apache.org/

Here are the supported build commands:
- clean: Removes all the generated files (including the Java class files and the javadoc files)
- document: Runs the javadoc tool to generate the API documentation (as HTML files)
- compile: Compiles the application
- test: Compiles the test suite and runs it
